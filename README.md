# I am - ETHBogota 2022

“I AM” is the mobile web3 Self-Sovereign NFT ID that helps Latin Americans control their future—enabling access to the quality of life that is currently unavailable for them, making them visible to their countries.

## How it's Made

**First Use:** This project uses Worldcoin for PPPoPP verification in the front, to give access to build a NFT zk ID, that will be minted into a smart contract into the Polygon, Mina, Aztec, Scroll, and Streamr Network protocols. Once minted, the users will have access to their ID on our platform.

Our host and information management will be IPFS for safety and decentralization.

**Daily Use:** Users can log in using WalletConnect, Metamask, ENS, and Coinbase to access the private smart contract and ID.
